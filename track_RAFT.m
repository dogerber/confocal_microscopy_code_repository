function [trks,res] = track_RAFT(xyzt,maxdisp,varargin)

% % This is a piece of code that unscrambles n-dimensional trajectories
% from a list of particle coordinates determined at discrete times (e.g.
% consecutive video frames). This tracker has been designed to be
% interchangeable with the function, track.m, by John Crocker that is widely
% used for particle tracking. It works when you have many particles visible
% at every timepoint. It is not suitable for tracking a few individual
% particles.
% Benefits of this new code are:
%   - it is typically much faster (it includes a waitbar, so you can
%     estimate how long you need to wait).
%   - It can work with very large displacements (much larger than the
%     average particle spacing in each frame), provided that clusters of
%     particles move together. This means that it is very good at tracking
%     tracer particles on, or in deforming solids. Also, it works well for
%     particles in fluid flow, when particles do not rearrange between
%     frames (including standard diffusion experiments with the usual small
%     timesteps).
%   - It typically has far fewer obviously wrong tracks. The Hungarian
%     algorithm (which track.m and [1] uses) tries to match up as many
%     particle pairs as possible. This function only matches up pairs if
%     the pairs have one-to-one correspondance in the penalty matrix.
%   However, the code does not let particles disappear and reappear if a
%   frame is missing, as track.m can.
%
% Examples of the code's use can be found in [2,3].
% For tracking large displacements in solids, we have found it useful to
% combine this code with a step to remove obviously wrong tracks, with the
% function remove_outliers_RAFT [2].

% e.g. trks=track_RAFT(xyzt,2,'dim',3,'y',1)
% where  trks = [x,y, t, id] or [x,y,z,t,id]

% Inputs: xyzt: an array with the last column being the time (must be
% discrete... i.e. 1 2 3 4, not real times (i.e. 0.1 0.2 0.3). The first
% dim columns should be the particle points.
% Note - there must be at least n_consider + 1 particles at each time
% point, or the code will creash.

% maxdisp: an estimate of the maximum displacement that a particle will
% possible take between frames

% OPTIONS
% 'min_track_length': the minimum number of timepoints that individual
% particles should contain. Must be 2 or greater. Default is 2
%
% 'dim': the dimensions of the data to be unscrambled. If there are more than
% dim+1 columns, the tracker assumes that the first dim columns are the
% locations, and the last is the frame number. It will return the contents
% of the middle columns in the final result. Default is one less than the
% number of columns
%
% 'n_consider': the number of neighbouring points to consider when tracking
% individual points from frame to frame (the tracker looks for clusters of
% particles moving together, which helps remove drift). Default is 10
%
% 'n_use': the number of particles from n_consider to keep when calculating
% the penalty matrix. Essentially the tracker tries to match n_consider
% points around a particle at time 1,p1 ,to n_consider points around a particle
% at time 2, p2, to see if those points move together relative to the
% displacement from p1 to p2. If n_use<n_consider, the penalty function for
% p1 to p2 takes the smallest n_use out of n_consider displacements of the particle cloud,
% and adds their magnitude together. The idea is that if you know you have
% lost particles due to poor imaging, or particles going in and out of
% focus, you can reduce n_use relative to n_consider, and it will account
% for that. In general, the more you keep track of your particles in all
% your frames, the higher n_use should be relative to n_consider.
% n_use must be <= n_consider. If n_use>n_consider, it will be
% automatically set as n_consider. Default is 8.
%
% 'x': Tell the program that you want tracked displacements to be < this
% in the z direction (1st column). Default is maxdisp
%
% 'y': Tell the program that you want tracked displacements to be < this
% in the y direction (2nd column). Default is maxdisp
%
% 'z': Tell the program that you want tracked displacements to be < this
% in the z direction (3rd column). Default is maxdisp

% Outputs: trks: unscrambled data, where last column is particle number,
% previous columns are the same as in xyzt...

% res: res(tp).idx(:,1) is the indices of particles that were connected
% with res(tp).idx(:,2) in the next timepoint
%

%
% Notes by Rob. This runs pretty well for large data sets, though if
% needed, step 2 can be optimised to avoid id_tot containing lots of zeros.
% In particular, I would be tempted to remove rows from id_tot when a track
% terminates, and immediately add them to the trks structure.
